RiffRaff outside the Guardian
=============================

RiffRaff is pretty awesome and it would be nice if people outside of the Guardian could get a taste of the awesomeness.

 * Support for Jenkins as well as Teamcity
 * Attempt to set up RiffRaff elsewhere to deploy something and see what breaks
 * Review how Guardian specific the documentation is
 * Get the documentation built to Github pages and put in some shiny screenshots
 * Blog on guardian developer blog
 * Yak on about it at conferences

RiffRaff as development hub
===========================

It may be desirable to allow RiffRaff to do things like track pull requests so that it can act as a hub for tracking project activity.

Move repository to RiffRaff
===========================

Since that's what everyone calls it

Upgrade Scala/Play etc.
======================
