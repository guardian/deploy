Command Line Client
===================

Logging - We should copy all stdout and logs into a logging facility (syslog, file?)
IRC Connection - Executing a deploy should mention to IRC what is going on.
Configuration - FEatures like logging, irc etc, should be configurable on the deploy host
TeamCity Support - Upon deploying we should tag and pin builds in teamcity.

Deployment Library
==================

Convention over Configuration - in deploy.json, there should be a default "default" recipe, and a default action per package.

RiffRaff
========

Prototype 0 - This should allow you to 1 button click to deploy.
Authentication - Using OpenId, you should only be allowed to login if you have a valid domain account
Realtime logs - You should be able to see all deploys happening, including feedback from the deploy as it happens
Current Status Database - We should keep a list of what was last deployed to each server.

Enhancements / Future Stuff
===========================

IRC Control - Kick off a deploy from irc?
Twitter integration - Alert to deploys via twitter account
XMPP Support - Use XMPP/Google Chat to send notifications about deploys
