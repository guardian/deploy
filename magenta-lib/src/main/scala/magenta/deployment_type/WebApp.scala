        |The WebApp trait deploys JVM based web applications that are deployed by copying over a new artifact (a WAR or
        |executable JAR) and restarting a container.
        |
        |The deploy type does the following for each host that is being deployed to:
        |
        | - block the firewall
        | - copy the new artifact over to the target host
        | - execute the container's restart command
        | - wait for the container's port to open again
        | - wait for all `heathcheck_paths` to return a healthy HTTP status code
        | - unblock the firewall
        |
        |Two actions are provided: `deploy` and `restart`. These are identical except that in the latter case the actual
        |copying of the artifact to the target host is not carried out, resulting in a rolling restart of all hosts.
