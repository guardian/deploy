Deploy system documentation
===========================

This is the documentation for magenta and riff-raff.

It is split into two parts: Magenta (the deploy library that actually deals with the mechanics of how an artifact
is fetched and deployed) and Riff Raff (the web application that makes it easy to deploy software).

 - [Magenta documentation](./magenta-lib/) - if you want to know how to set up your application for deployment
 - [Riff-raff documentation](./riffraff/) - if you want to know how to use, configure and develop riff-raff
