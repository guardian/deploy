Dashboards
==========

Dashboards provide an overview of the latest builds deployed to one or more projects.

To create a dashboard, simply create a URL to /deployment/dashboard?projects=<comma separated projects>.

This will then query the deployment records and display a matrix of the builds that were most recently deployed.
