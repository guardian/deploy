# Contributing
First, and most importantly, thanks!

## Running locally
1. Install the requirements 
   - Java 11
   - SBT
   - Docker
You will also require `Deploy Tools - Developer` permissions from Janus in order to run locally.

2. Create configuration
Create a configuration file at `~/.gu/riff-raff.conf`. At a minimum it looks like this,
replacing placeholders with appropriate values:

   ```
   artifact.aws.bucketName=<ARTIFACTS BUCKET NAME>
   build.aws.bucketName=<BUILDS BUCKET NAME>
   
   db.default.url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:7432/riffraff"
   db.default.user="riffraff"
   db.default.hostname="riffraff"
   db.default.password="riffraff"
   
   lookup.prismUrl=<PRISM URL>
   lookup.source="prism"
   ```
3. From the root of the repository, run:

   ```sh
   ./script/start
   ```
   
   Add `--debug` to attach a remote debugger on port 9999.
4. Visit http://localhost:9000/
5. Details of how to configure Riff-Raff can then be found at http://localhost:9000/docs/riffraff/administration/properties

## Raising a PR
It's worth reading the [Pull Request recommendations](https://github.com/guardian/recommendations/blob/main/pull-requests.md) first.

Adding tests, particularly if you're modifying existing code, is preferable.

Tests can be run locally via:

```sh
./script/test
```

## A note about CI
Unfortunately, there is a long standing bug where CI will randomly fail with a message similar to:

```log
scala.reflect.internal.Symbols$CyclicReference: illegal cyclic reference involving class GetParameterResponse
```

We've not managed to fully resolve this. If you can, that'd be amazing!

The problem usually resolves itself if you re-run the build.
If you're still seeing the error, it's worth compiling and running the tests locally to be sure it's not a genuine issue with your branch.
